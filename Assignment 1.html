   <h2>Harry Peabrain <br>
A Very Odd but Special Person.</h2>
<p>Harry Peabrain is an itinerant soldier of fortune in the nasty war against outdated dairy products
        remaining on grocery store shelves. Scarred at an early age by a particularly fetid container of
        sour chocolate milk, he has vowed to protect others from being exposed to similar atrocities.
        Harry lists the following products as being the most likely to be spoiled and out of date: <br>
        Chocolate milk <br>
        Ostrich eggs <br>
        Moose cow milk<br>
        Harry insists that the problem varies from one region of the country to another, with the
following region and grocery store chains being cited as the worse offenders. <br>
Midwest<br>
Groovin Groceries, Inc.,<br>
Buy Low, Sell High, Corp.<br>
In a recent interview Harry stated:<br>
"If I were to let moss grow under my feet, then mildew would be growing in every grocery
cooler in America."</p>
